# Labyrinth
Find the shortest path from the start ("S") to the exit ("E").
Movement is allowed only in four directions: up, down, left, and right. You need to return the
length of the shortest path from "S" to "E". If no path exists, return -1.

## Testing the solution
To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](http://nodejs.org/#download) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:
```bash
    npm install
    npm start
```
To run the tests 
```bash
    npm run test
```
